        <h2> Biography </h2>
        
        <p> Jeff Bezos, (born Jan. 12, 1964, Albuquerque, N.M., U.S.), U.S. Internet entrepreneur. Educated at Princeton University, 
            he worked in banking and investment at Bankers Trust and D.E. Shaw & Co. before founding Amazon.com, Inc., in 1995. 
            The Internet company began as a bookseller and later expanded into recorded music, videos, electronic equipment, tools, and 
            other areas, including online auctions. Amazon.com became famous for the extraordinary rise in its stock-market valuation
             despite continued annual losses—a reflection of investor confidence in the future of online retailing that 
             marked the late 1990s. The company posted its first quarterly profit in January 2002. In 2007 it released a portable wireless
              electronic reading device called the Kindle, which proved incredibly popular. In 2013 Bezos acquired The Washington Post and
               affiliated publications.</p>
